# Activity-Recognition-using-Smartphone-Accelerometers-Using-Python
## Project Overview
Monitoring human movements can be useful for various purposes, including sports and healthcare applications. This project focuses on developing a solution for Active Assisted Living (AAL) in the healthcare sector, specifically targeting senior care. The main objective is to achieve permanent and accurate monitoring of individuals' activities to respond promptly to critical events such as falls. The monitoring can be accomplished using accelerometers and other sensors commonly found in smartphones.

## Project Goals
This project aims to analyze accelerometer data collected from smartphones to classify and identify 12 different activities, including dynamic, static, and transitional movements. The activities to be recognized are as follows:

Dynamic Movements:
Walking
Walking Upstairs
Walking Downstairs
Static Movements:
4. Sitting
Standing
Lying Down
Transitional Movements:
7. Standing to Sitting
Sitting to Standing
Sitting to Lying
Lying to Sitting
Standing to Lying
Lying to Standing


## Programming Language: Python
